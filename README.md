## Description 

Description: The "React User Age Tracker" is a user-friendly web application designed to help you keep track of user information effortlessly. With a simple input form that includes fields for Username and Age (in years), the application ensures data integrity by displaying an error modal if the form is submitted without filling out both fields or if the age is below one or greater than 100. Once valid user data is submitted, the application displays a list of users and their respective ages below the input form, allowing you to continuously add users to the list as needed. This project provides a seamless and intuitive way to manage user data while ensuring data accuracy and validation.
